# rectangles

## Overview
This project implements some algorithms to analyze relations between rectangles:
* Intersection
* Containment
* Adjacency

## project structure
Looking for future expansion of the project, a Shape class was created to allow different shapes to inherit its methods.
Rectangle class extends Shapes and contains his own methods to validate relations with other shapes.
Point class is used to build shapes. 

## prerequisites
* Java 11
* Junit-jupiter

## how to run
Inside the `src/main/java` directory run:
```bash
javac Main.java
bash java Main
